# Railway-DeadLock-Stimulation
This project is a Railway Deadlock Simulation System using C, HTML, and Python. It applies the Bankerâ€™s Algorithm to model resource allocation in a multi-track railway environment, simulating deadlock scenarios and identifying safe or unsafe states based on available resources.
